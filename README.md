## Creating a new Import
 
An import consists of a bunch of components:
 
 * A source - Responsible for reading the data
 * A specification - Responsible for transforming and filtering the data
 * A Writer - Responsible for saving the data
 
In this section we will create an import named `price`.

### Create a module

The first step of using the import module is to create a new module in your project to contain the import configuration
and any code you may have to write. Go ahead and create that - our convention is `Vendor/Import`. We will create an 
example module in this documentation to help show the concepts.

We will use [N98 magerun2](https://github.com/netz98/n98-magerun2) to do this: 

```sh
$ n98 dev:module:create MyVendor Import
```

Delete the `events.xml` & `crontab.xml` files from the modules `etc` directory, we don't need those.
 
### Define the import configuration
 
Define the import in your module in an `imports.xml` file:

In our example that would be `app/code/MyVendor/Import/etc/imports.xml`
  
```xml
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:module:Jh_Import:etc/imports.xsd">
    <files name="price">
        <!-- other required config> -->
    </files>
</config>
```

The `files` key here represents the type of import. In this case a files type. Supported import types:
* `files`
* `db`
* `webapi`

You can see the supported types in the `$types` property of [src/Import/Manager.php](src/Import/Manager.php).

### Files import type

The `name` attribute is the unique name for your import and is how you execute it from `\Jh\Import\Import\Manager`. Here we named
it `price`.

The required configuration values for your import are:

 * source
 * match_files
 * specification
 * writer
 * id_field

Optional values are:

 * incoming_directory  - default: `jh_import/incoming`
 * archived_directory  - default: `jh_import/archived`
 * failed_directory  - default: `jh_import/failed`
 * archive_already_imported_files - default: `false`
 * process_only_last_file - default: `false`
 
The above directories will be created in the `var` directory of the magento instance if they do not already exist.

#### source

This should be the name of a class or a virtual type. It should point to a class which implements `Jh\Import\Source\Source`.
The only source type currently available is `Jh\Import\Source\Csv` for reading CSV files. You can customise the constructor 
arguments by using a virtual type.

#### incoming_directory

If this value is left unspecified it will default to: `jh_import/incoming`
 
This is where your files will be read from. This directory will be prefixed with the absolute path of the Magento installations `var` directory.

For example, you specify: `vendor_import/incoming` translates to: `/var/www/magento/var/vendor_import/incoming`

#### archived_directory

If this value is left unspecified it will default to: `jh_import/archived`
 
This is where your files will be moved to if they successfully import. This directory will be prefixed with the absolute path of the Magento installations `var` directory.

For example, you specify: `vendor_import/archived` translates to: `/var/www/magento/var/vendor_import/archived`

#### failed_directory

If this value is left unspecified it will default to: `jh_import/failed`
 
This is where your files will be moved to if they fail to import. This directory will be prefixed with the absolute path of the Magento installations `var` directory.

For example, you specify: `vendor_import/failed` translates to: `/var/www/magento/var/vendor_import/failed`

#### match_files

Here you can configure which files should be read from the directory based on their name, the values can be:

 * `*` - read all files in the directory
 * a regex, for example: `/[a-z]+\.csv/` - read all files which have a csv extension and only contain lower case alpha chars in the name
 * a static name, for example `stock.csv` - read only a file named `stock.csv`, if it exists
 
#### specification
 
This should be the name of a class or a virtual type. It should point to a class which implements `Jh\Import\Specification\ImportSpecification`.
This is the class which takes care of manipulating the incoming data in to a generic format. This will be explained in more detail later on.

#### writer

This should be the name of a class or a virtual type. It should point to a class which implements `Jh\Import\Writer\Writer`.
This is the class which takes care of saving the data in to Magento. This will be explained in more detail later on.

#### id_field

This should be the name of a field that exists in every row of the data and is unique. This is used for logging purposes. For example it would
probably be `sku` for a product import.

The finished config my look like:

```xml
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:module:Jh_Import:etc/imports.xsd">
    <files name="price">
        <source>Jh\Import\Source\Csv</source>
        <incoming_directory>jh_import/incoming</incoming_directory>
        <match_files>/price_\d{8}.csv/</match_files>
        <specification>MyVendor\Import\Specification\Price</specification>
        <writer>MyVendor\Import\Writer\Price</writer>
        <id_field>sku</id_field>
    </files>
</config>
```

#### archive_already_imported_files

By enabling this option all files reported as already imported will be moved into `failed_directory` 
 instead of being left in `incoming_directory`. 

#### process_only_last_file

This option enabled will process only last file from matched batch of files. Useful when you have multiple files of same content 
 and you want to save your processing time by importing data only from last one of them. Other matched files from batch 
 will be moved into `failed_directory`.

### DB import type

The `name` attribute is the unique name for your import and is how you execute it from `\Jh\Import\Import\Manager`. Here we named
it `price`.

The required configuration values for your import are:

* connection_name
* source
* specification
* writer
* id_field
* source_id
* select_sql
* count_sql

#### connection_name

Name of the DB connection to use. The connection should be specified in `app/etc/env.php`. E.g.
```
'db' => [
        'table_prefix' => '',
        'connection' => [
            'default' => [
                'host' => 'db',
                'dbname' => 'docker',
                'username' => 'docker',
                'password' => 'docker',
                'model' => 'mysql4',
                'engine' => 'innodb',
                'initStatements' => 'SET NAMES utf8;',
                'active' => '1',
                'driver_options' => [
                    1014 => false
                ]
            ],
            'migration' => [
                'host' => 'db',
                'dbname' => 'migration',
                'username' => 'root',
                'password' => 'docker',
                'model' => 'mysql4',
                'engine' => 'innodb',
                'initStatements' => 'SET NAMES utf8;',
                'active' => '1',
                'driver_options' => [
                    1014 => false
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ],
    'resource' => [
        'default_setup' => [
            'connection' => 'default'
        ],
        'migration' => [
            'connection' => 'migration'
        ]
    ],
```

#### source

This should be the name of a class or a virtual type. It should point to a class which implements `Jh\Import\Source\Source`.
The core source type currently available is `Jh\Import\Source\Db` for reading data from a database. It can be extended
further to customise it. 

#### specification

This should be the name of a class or a virtual type. It should point to a class which implements `Jh\Import\Specification\ImportSpecification`.
This is the class which takes care of manipulating the incoming data in to a generic format. This will be explained in more detail later on.

#### writer

This should be the name of a class or a virtual type. It should point to a class which implements `Jh\Import\Writer\Writer`.
This is the class which takes care of saving the data in to Magento. This will be explained in more detail later on.

#### id_field

This should be the name of a field that exists in every row of the data and is unique. This is used for logging purposes. For example it would
probably be `sku` for a product import.

#### source_id

A unique ID for the import type.

#### select_sql

SQL query used for loading data from the DB. If you need a more advanced way of loading data, overwrite the source class.

#### count_sql

SQL query used for counting the data to update.

==================================================================================================================

The finished config could look like:

```xml
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:module:Jh_Import:etc/imports.xsd">
    <db name="customer">
        <connection_name>migration</connection_name>
        <source>Jh\Import\Source\Db</source>
        <specification>MyVendor\Import\Specification\Customer</specification>
        <writer>MyVendor\Import\Writer\Customer</writer>
        <id_field>id_customer</id_field>
        <source_id>customer_migration</source_id>
        <select_sql>SELECT * FROM ps_customer</select_sql>
        <count_sql>SELECT COUNT(1) FROM ps_customer</count_sql>
        <indexers>
            <indexer>customer_grid</indexer>
        </indexers>
    </db>
</config>
```

### Webapi import type

The `name` attribute is the unique name for your import and is how you execute it from `\Jh\Import\Import\Manager`. Here we named
it `test`.

The configuration values for your import are:

* source
* specification
* writer
* id_field
* source_id
* count_request_factory
* count_response_handler
* data_request_factory
* data_request_paging_decorator
* data_request_filter_decorator
* data_request_page_decorator
* data_request_filter_decorator (optional)
* data_request_response_handler

#### source

This should be the name of a class or a virtual type. It should point to a class which implements `Jh\Import\Source\Source`.
The core source type currently available is `Jh\Import\Source\Webapi` for reading data from a database. It can be extended
further to customise it. 

#### specification

This should be the name of a class or a virtual type. It should point to a class which implements `Jh\Import\Specification\ImportSpecification`.
This is the class which takes care of manipulating the incoming data in to a generic format. This will be explained in more detail later on.

#### writer

This should be the name of a class or a virtual type. It should point to a class which implements `Jh\Import\Writer\Writer`.
This is the class which takes care of saving the data in to Magento. This will be explained in more detail later on.

#### id_field

This should be the name of a field that exists in every row of the data and is unique. This is used for logging purposes. For example it would
probably be `sku` for a product import.

#### source_id

A unique ID for the import type.

#### count_request_factory

This should be a class implementing `Jh\Import\Source\Webapi\RequestFactoryInterface`. It should return object of `Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface` built
to be sent to get entities amount. This building process is encapsulated inside object, so it can be implemented inside migration module
and prevent changing abstraction by import module (open-closed principle).

#### count_response_handler

This should be a class implementing `Jh\Import\Source\Webapi\CountResponseHandlerInterface`. It should return integer telling how many entites do we have to migrate. 
The handling process is encapsulated inside object, so it can be implemented inside migration module
and prevent changing abstraction by import module. (open-closed principle)

#### data_request_factory

This should be a class implementing `Jh\Import\Source\Webapi\RequestFactoryInterface`. It should return object of `Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface` built
to be sent to get actual data. This building process is encapsulated inside object, so it can be implemented inside migration module
and prevent changing abstraction by import module (open-closed principle).

#### data_request_paging_decorator

This should be a class implementing `Jh\Import\Source\Webapi\DataRequest\PagingDecoratorInterface`. It should return object of `Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface` built
which is modified to contain paging parameters. This building process is encapsulated inside object, so it can be implemented inside migration module
and prevent changing abstraction by import module (open-closed principle).

#### data_request_filter_decorator (optional)

This should be a class implementing `Jh\Import\Source\Webapi\DataRequest\FilterDecoratorInterface`. It should return object of `Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface` built
which is modified to contain filtering parameters. This building process is encapsulated inside object, so it can be implemented inside migration module
and prevent changing abstraction by import module (open-closed principle).

#### data_request_page_size
This should be integer telling how many entities should be retrieved in one page from webapi.

#### data_response_handler

This should be a class implementing `Jh\Import\Source\Webapi\DataResponseHandlerInterface`. It should return iterable, so data can be iterated and persisted into db.
The handling process is encapsulated inside object, so it can be implemented inside migration module
and prevent changing abstraction by import module. (open-closed principle).

==================================================================================================================

The finished config could look like:

```xml
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:module:Jh_Import:etc/imports.xsd">

      <data_response_handler>MyVendor\Import\Specification\Response\DataResponseHandler</data_response_handler>
    </webapi>
</config>
```

Example module can be found in [examples](examples/webapi).

### Create the specification

Create the class from the configuration we just mentioned: `MyVendor\Import\Specification\Price`. This class should implement
`Jh\Import\Specification\ImportSpecification`.

There is one method which should be fulfilled as part of the contract: `public function configure(Importer $import);`
This method allows you to configure the importer by adding transformers and filters. A transformer and a filter are simply
PHP callables.

#### Transformers

A transformer is used to rename columns, manipulate data and organise it. For example if the sku column comes in as `Product_Number`
from the CSV file (`Product_Number` would be the column header in the CSV), you might want to rename it to `sku` so your writer accepts
generic data. You could do this like:

```php
<?php
class Price implements \Jh\Import\Specification\ImportSpecification
{
    public function configure(\Jh\Import\Import\Importer $importer)
    {
        $importer->transform(function (\Jh\Import\Import\Record $record, \Jh\Import\Report\ReportItem $report) {
            $record->renameColumn('Product_Number', 'sku');
        });
    }
}
```

This transformer function will be ran on every row read from the source. The importer will convert that row from the source
in to a `Record` object. The `Record` object has many methods on it for manipulating data, some are listed below:

 * `setColumnValue(string $columnName, $value): void`
 * `unset(string $columnName): void`
 * `unsetMany(string ...$columnNames): void`
 * `only(string ...$columnNames): void`
 * `getColumnValue(string $columnName, $default = null, $dataType = null): mixed`
 * `getColumnValueAndUnset(string $columnName, $default = null, $dataType = null): mixed`
 * `columnExists(string $columnName): bool`
 * `transform(string $column, callable $callable): void`
 * `renameColumn(string $columnFrom, string $columnTo): void`
 * `moveColumnToArray(string $columnFrom, string $columnTo, string $key = null): void`
 * `moveMultipleColumnsToArray(array $columns, string $columnTo): void`
 * `addValueToArray(string $column, string $key, $value): void
 * `addValueToArray(string $column, string $key, $value): void
 
`transform(string $column, callable $callable): void` is particularly interesting as it can be passed any
PHP callable, so also an invokable class which can change the data. See [src/Transformer](src/Transformer) for
examples of transformers. The `ProductStatusTransformer` maps an `enabled` or `disabled` string value in the import to 
the correct Magento constants.

**Note** You also have access to the `Report` object here where you can add errors and debug information. You might add a debug message
if a particular product status was not recognised.

**Note** You can add as many transformers as you need.

#### Filters

Filters allow you to ignore some rows of data from the source. Ff the filter returns false for a particular record, then it
will be discarded. See below where we ignore something with a price of over 100, completely arbitrary of course.

```php
<?php
class Price implements \Jh\Import\Specification\ImportSpecification
{
    public function configure(\Jh\Import\Import\Importer $importer)
    {
        $importer->filter(function (\Jh\Import\Import\Record $record, \Jh\Import\Report\ReportItem $report) {
            return $record->getColumnValue('price') <= 100;
        });
    }
}
```

See [src/Filter/SkipNonExistingProducts.php](src/Filter/SkipNonExistingProducts.php)
for an example of a filter which skips rows which reference sku's which do not exist in the system.

You would add this filter like this:

```php
<?php
class Price implements \Jh\Import\Specification\ImportSpecification
{
    public function configure(\Jh\Import\Import\Importer $importer)
    {
        //using an injected object manager to create the filter
        $importer->filter($this->objectManager->get(\Jh\Import\Filter\SkipNonExistingProducts::class));
        //or you could just inject the filter
        $importer->filter($this->skipExistingProductsFilter);
    }
}
```

**Note** You can add as many filters as you need.

### Create the writer

Create the class from the configuration we mentioned in the defining configuration section: `MyVendor\Import\Writer\Price`. This class should implement
`Jh\Import\Writer\Writer`. The writer is responsible for saving the data in to Magento, it could be using a model repository, resource model
or directly using the db adapter (if performance is a concern). The writer is passed each record from the source (after it has been transformed and filtered)
and you must save it. A very basic price writer might look like:

```php
<?php

class Price implements \Jh\Import\Writer\Writer
{

    private $productRepository;
    
    public function __construct(ProductRepositoryInterface $productRepository)
    {
        $this->productRepository = $productRepository;
    }
    
    public function prepare(\Jh\Import\Source\Source $source)
    {
        //use this method to do any preparation you might need for the writing
        //for example loading config, data from other tables, etc.
    }
    
    public function write(\Jh\Import\Import\Record $record, \Jh\Import\Report\ReportItem $reportItem)
    {
        $price = $record->getColumnValue('price');
        $sku   = $record->getColumnValue('sku');
        
        $product = $this->productRepository->get($sku);
        $product->setPrice($price);
        
        $this->productRepository->save($product);
    }
    
    public function finish(\Jh\Import\Source\Source $source) : Jh\Import\Import\Result 
    {
        return new Result([]);
    }
}
```

**Note** It is your responsibility in the writer to catch any exceptions and deal with any errors which may happen. You 
should log any errors to the `$reportItem` object.

**Note** The product repository is extremely slow to load and save so I would not advise to use it. For the product import
I used the resource model, but again, loading any saving each product is going to take an extremely long time. It will be necessary
to investigate whether just one attribute can be saved on a product - and maybe it is not necessary to even load the product first.

#### Indexing

Usually whenever you save anything in Magento 2 - it will run the required indexers for each save performed for that entity. This is a slow a costly 
process. We can batch reindex at the end instead, by returning a result object from `finish` containing all the ids which should be reindexed. The indexers
which are indexed with these id's are specified by config:

```xml
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:module:Jh_Import:etc/imports.xsd">
    <files name="price">
        <source>Jh\Import\Source\Csv</source>
        <incoming_directory>jh_import/incoming</source>
        <match_files>/price_\d{8}.csv/</source>
        <specification>MyVendor\Import\Specification\Price</specification>
        <writer>MyVendor\Import\Writer\Price</specification>
        <id_field>sku</id_field>
        <indexers>
            <indexer>catalog_product_price</indexer>
            <indexer>catalog_product_attribute</indexer>
            <indexer>catalog_product_category</indexer>
            <indexer>catalog_product_flat</indexer>
            <indexer>catalogsearch_fulltext</indexer>
        </indexers>
    </files>
</config>
```

Note the additional `indexers` key above. To find which indexers are triggered for the save of your entity, it will be necessary to debug
through the saving process and look through any plugins and events which may be dispatched along the process. `catalog_product_price` is the 
indexer id and can be found on the indexer class, for example, the constant: `\Magento\Catalog\Model\Indexer\Product\Price\Processor::INDEXER_ID`.

By specifying these indexers in the config, at the start of the import, the importer will disable those indexers. Then if you return a `Result` object
from the `finish` method of your writer with some id's in it, the importer will run those id's through all the indexers you specified.

You can do that by recording the id of the entity you saved every time, for example you could amend the writer like so:

```php
<?php

class Price implements \Jh\Import\Writer\Writer
{
    private $productRepository;   
    private $savedProductIds = [];
    
    public function __construct(ProductRepositoryInterface $productRepository)
    {
        $this->productRepository = $productRepository;
    }
    
    public function prepare(\Jh\Import\Source\Source $source)
    {
        $this->savedProductIds = [];
        //use this method to do any preparation you might need for the writing
        //for example loading config, data from other tables, etc.
    }
    
    public function write(\Jh\Import\Import\Record $record, \Jh\Import\Report\ReportItem $reportItem)
    {
        $price = $record->getColumnValue('price');
        $sku   = $record->getColumnValue('sku');
        
        $product = $this->productRepository->get($sku);
        $product->setPrice($price);
        
        $this->productRepository->save($product);
        $this->savedProductIds[] = $product->getId();
    }
    
    public function finish(\Jh\Import\Source\Source $source) : \Jh\Import\Import\Result 
    {
        return new \Jh\Import\Import\Result($this->savedProductIds);
    }
}
```

### Configure default options for import types

All import types options can have their default values configured through `app/etc/config.php` or `app/etc/env.php`.

```php
    'system' => [
        'default' => [
            ...
            'jh_import' => [
                'default' => [
                    'files' => [
                        'source' => \Jh\Import\Source\Csv::class,
                        'archive_date_format' => 'YmdHis',
                        'directory_permissions' => 0755,
                    ],
                    'db' => [
                        'connection_name' => 'default',
                    ],
                ]
            ],
            ...
        ],
        ...
    ],
    ...
```

## Report Handlers

Report handlers deal with debug information and errors that happen during the import process. By default the only report handler
added to the import process is the database handler. This logs all messages to database tables which can be viewed
in the admin. Another report handler is added automatically based on the environment. If the magento instance is in developer mode
or the import is manually triggered from the CLI the console handler is added. This logs the messages directly to the CLI.

This section details the existing report handlers and how to use them. It also details how to create your own report handlers.

### Bundled Handlers

The following handlers are bundled with the library:

 * [Jh\Import\Report\Handler\DatabaseHandler](#jhimportreporthandlerdatabasehandler)
 * [Jh\Import\Report\Handler\ConsoleHandler](#jhimportreporthandlerconsolehandler)
 * [Jh\Import\Report\Handler\EmailHandler](#jhimportreporthandleremailhandler)
 
#### Bundled Handler Usage

To use an additional report handler, you just add the class name or the name of a virtual type to the import configuration:

```xml
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:module:Jh_Import:etc/imports.xsd">
    <files name="price">
        <source>Jh\Import\Source\Csv</source>
        <incoming_directory>jh_import/incoming</source>
        <match_files>/price_\d{8}.csv/</source>
        <specification>MyVendor\Import\Specification\Price</specification>
        <writer>MyVendor\Import\Writer\Price</specification>
        <id_field>sku</id_field>
        <report_handlers>
            <report_handler>Jh\Import\Report\Handler\EmailHandler</report_handler>
            <report_handler>my_report_handler</report_handler>
        </report_handlers>
    </files>
</config>
```

#### Jh\Import\Report\Handler\DatabaseHandler

This handler is always added to the import.

#### Jh\Import\Report\Handler\ConsoleHandler

This handler is automatically added based on the magento mode. It also automatically added if the import
is triggered manually from the CLI.

#### Jh\Import\Report\Handler\EmailHandler

The mail handler will send an e-mail at the end of the import, if any messages/errors occur. Before sending the e-mail, the e-mail handler
will pass the emails to strategy which can filter/organise the logs. 

A strategy is an instance of `\Jh\Import\Report\Handler\Email\Strategy\EmailHandlerStrategy` and the default is `\Jh\Import\Report\Handler\Email\Strategy\FingersCrossedMax`

The provided strategies are as follows:

* `\Jh\Import\Report\Handler\Email\Strategy\FingersCrossed` - Send all logs after a log of a given severity is hit. The minimum severity is provided as a constructor arg
* `\Jh\Import\Report\Handler\Email\Strategy\FingersCrossedMax` - Same as the previous one with a maximum number of logs. Severity and max provided as constructor args
* `\Jh\Import\Report\Handler\Email\Strategy\All` - Forwards every single messages regardless of severity
* `\Jh\Import\Report\Handler\Email\Strategy\AboveLevelWithContext` - Sends all logs over a given severity with the previous and next 5 logs regardless of severity to provide context

To use a different strategy globally for all imports define a preference for `\Jh\Import\Report\Handler\Email\Strategy\EmailHandlerStrategy` in your import module. You can use virtual types to configure the 
various arguments of the strategies. 

Or to scope it to a particular import, when defining your email handler virtual type, specify your strategy virtual type there.

To configure the mail handler, you need to create a virtual type which specifies the constructor arguments:

```xml
<!-- in a di.xml file -->
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:ObjectManager/etc/config.xsd">
    <virtualType name="my_email_handler" type="Jh\Import\Report\Handler\EmailHandler">
        <arguments>
            <argument name="recipients" xsi:type="array">
                <item name="aydin" xsi:type="string">aydin@wearejh.com</item>            
            </argument>
            <argument name="fromAddress" xsi:type="string">import@wearejh.com</argument>
            <argument name="fromName" xsi:type="string">JH Import </argument>
        </arguments>
    </virtualType>
</config>
<!-- uses the default strategy -->
```

To use a different strategy globally:

```xml
<!-- in a di.xml file -->
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:ObjectManager/etc/config.xsd">
    <preference for="Jh\Import\Report\Handler\Email\Strategy\EmailHandlerStrategy" type="Jh\Import\Report\Handler\Email\Strategy\All" />
</config>
<!-- Sets all instances of Jh\Import\Report\Handler\EmailHandler to use `All` strategy by default -->
```

To use a different strategy for one import (or whichever use this email handler):

```xml
<!-- in a di.xml file -->
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:ObjectManager/etc/config.xsd">
    <virtualType name="my_email_handler" type="Jh\Import\Report\Handler\EmailHandler">
        <arguments>
            <argument name="recipients" xsi:type="array">
                <item name="aydin" xsi:type="string">aydin@wearejh.com</item>            
            </argument>
            <argument name="fromAddress" xsi:type="string">import@wearejh.com</argument>
            <argument name="fromName" xsi:type="string">JH Import </argument>
            <argument name="emailHandlerStrategy" xsi:type="object">my_email_handler_strategy</argument>
        </arguments>
    </virtualType>
    <virtualType name="my_email_handler_strategy" type="Jh\Import\Report\Handler\Email\Strategy\FingersCrossedMax">
        <arguments>
            <argument name="logLevel" xsi:type="const">Jh\Import\LogLevel::CRITICAL</argument>
            <argument name="maxMessages" xsi:type="number">500</argument>
        </arguments>
    </virtualType>
</config>
<!-- Sets email handler `my_email_handler` to use the strategy defined as `my_email_handler_strategy` -->
```

You would then use the name of this virtual type `my_email_handler` and add it to the `report_handlers` config of your import.

### Creating custom handlers

You may want to send messages to a third party logging system. In order to do that you just need to implement the interface
`Jh\Import\Report\Handler\Handler`. See [src/Report/Handler](src/Report/Handler) for the existing implementations.

If your handler is fairly generic, consider pull requesting it to this repository. If it is project specific, keep it in the 
project repository. Using your custom report handler in an import is the same as the bundled handlers. Simply reference
the class name or a virtual type referencing the class name in the import configuration.

## Triggering an import

After an import is defined it can be retrieved from the import manager which is an instance of `\Jh\Import\Import\Manager`
So anywhere you have an instance of `\Jh\Import\Import\Manager` you can execute an import by its name.

For example:

```php
<?php

$objectManager->get(Jh\Import\Import\Manager::class)->executeImportByName($myImportName);
```

Where `$myImportName` is the name given to the import in `app/code/MyVendor/Import/etc/imports.xml`. In the case of our example
the import name would be `price`.

You may want to execute an import on a regular basis and for this you will want to create a cron job. Simply create a
cron job that is injected with `Jh\Import\Import\Manager` and executes the correct import. Set the cron schedule via
configuration. An example cron class might be:

```php
<?php

namespace MyVendor\Import\Cron;

use Jh\Import\Import\Manager;

class Price
{

    /**
     * @var Manager
     */
    private $importManager;

    public function __construct(Manager $importManager)
    {
        $this->importManager = $importManager;
    }

    public function execute()
    {
        $this->importManager->executeImportByName('price');
    }
}
```

The cron is just a dumb object, the Import Manager does the real work. 

If you create a cron for your import you should add the cron job name and the group (the one you specify in `crontab.xml`) to your import configuration defined in `app/code/MyVendor/Import/etc/imports.xml`. This will allow the import admin to display details about your cron configuration. See below for an example configuration:

```xml
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:module:Jh_Import:etc/imports.xsd">
    <files name="price">
        <source>Jh\Import\Source\Csv</source>
        <incoming_directory>jh_import/incoming</source>
        <match_files>/price_\d{8}.csv/</source>
        <specification>MyVendor\Import\Specification\Price</specification>
        <writer>MyVendor\Import\Writer\Price</specification>
        <id_field>sku</id_field>
        <cron>vendor_import_product</cron>
        <cron_group>default</cron_group>
    </files>
</config>
```

Where `vendor_import_product` is the cron job code specified in `crontab.xml`, for example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:module:Magento_Cron:etc/crontab.xsd">
    <group id="default">
        <job name="vendor_import_product" instance="Vendor\Import\Cron\Product" method="execute">
            <schedule>*/5 * * * *</schedule>
        </job>
    </group>
</config>
```

### Running an import manually

The import module provides a console command which allows to manually run an import, useful for testing and on-demand imports. To use it simply run
`php bin/magento jh-import:run <import-name>` substituting <import-name> for the name of the import you want to run defined in `app/code/MyVendor/Import/etc/imports.xml`. Eg: `price
.
You will get real time progress updates and live scrolling log including eta's and memory usage.

For reference the console command exists here: [src/Command/RunImportCommand.php](src/Command/RunImportCommand.php).

### Where do the files go?

The import files should be placed in the folders specified in `app/code/MyVendor/Import/etc/imports.xml` for your import.
The `match_files` config can support a regex, `*` (for everything in the dir) or a single file name for the files to process. If using a regex it should start and end with `/`.

See [src/Type/Files.php](src/Type/Files.php) for how the `match_files` config is parsed.

For example on a client project we use the regex `/RDrive_Export_\d{8}.txt/` to look for files. So it will pick up:

* `RDrive_Export_13022017.txt`
* `RDrive_Export_05042017.txt`

So before you run an import, you will need to make sure the file name matches the configuration file and it is placed in the correct folder.

## Viewing Import Configuration

Import configuration can be viewed in the admin area. All the information specified in `imports.xml` and more will be displayed there. Simply navigate to: Admin -> System -> JH Import -> Import Configuration. 

![Admin Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2817002/27139908-831b6b88-5124-11e7-8b2d-a57660895827.png)

### Listing Imports

You will first be presented with a list of the configured imports in your system, loaded from your `imports.xml` file. There will be a summary of some of the information in the table. Click the `Info` link on the import you want to view.

![Import Listing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2817002/27139907-831a80ec-5124-11e7-99d6-3aa57c777804.png)

### Viewing an Import

After clicking the link you will be presented with a page which details the particular import, like the following:

![Import View](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2817002/27139909-8320049a-5124-11e7-9f22-86672c0a0a66.png)

From here you can view the name, type, indexers which will be refreshed on import completion and the extra report handlers used. You can see the directories and the files within them. You can also see the file match pattern.

If you have specified a cron code for your import then the cron expression will also be shown here, with a link to a human readable decoded version, helpful for a client or PM to know when the import runs.

You will also see a selection of files listed in the import folders. For the archived and failed folders you will see the last 15 files sorted by their changed time, eg when they were moved to that folder. For the incoming folder you will see all files present.

#### Check Incoming Files

On the right-hand side you will see all the files currently in the incoming folder. These files are waiting to be processed. However, some of them will be ignored based on the `match_files` configuration. This sometimes causes confusion with clients when they incorrectly named their files wrong. From this screen they can see which files will and will not be processed, a green tick indicates that the file name matches the `match_files` directive and a red cross indicates that it does not. All files with a red cross will not be processed by this import. 

**Note** If multiple imports share the same incoming folder, you might see that some imports show they don't match a file that another import does, this is to be expected as different imports can have different `match_files` values.

#### Downloading Files

Any file from any of the folders can be download and viewed, simply click the file name.

#### Deleting Files

Any file from any of the folders can be deleted on the server, simply click the trash can icon next to the file name.

## Viewing Import Logs

Import logs can be viewed in the admin area. Simply navigate to: Admin -> System -> JH Import ->Import Log.

The listing will show the previous imports. Filter by import type and date to find the import you wish to view the logs for, then select
`View Logs`. The view is split into two listings:

### Item level logs

Issues which occurred at the item level, missing images, incorrect data etc. You should also find a reference to the line number which the error occurred on and also the
 primary key of the row so you can search the source for it. Note the line number may not always be completely accurate, it is an estimation. The primary key field is defined in `app/code/MyVendor/Import/etc/imports.xml`
for each import.

### Import level logs

Issues which occurred at the import level, for example: duplicate source detected, importer already running etc.

## Viewing Import Logs on the CLI

You can also get a summary of the logs on the CLI. Simply run the following command:

```shell
$ php bin/magento jh-import:view-logs <import-name>
```

Substituting <import-name> for the name of the import you want to run defined in `app/code/MyVendor/Import/etc/imports.xml`. Eg: `price`.

There is an optional second parameter to limit the number of log entries displayed, eg:

```shell
$ php bin/magento import:view-logs price 20
```

You will be presented with a table describing all the imports with the import name you entered, from here you must
enter the ID of the import you want to view the logs for.

## Sequence detection

The importer has sequence detection built in - in that you cannot import the same source twice. For example if your import uses
the csv source, the file will be hashed and stored. If you attempt to import the same file again the import will fail.

### Force running the same source again

You can force running the import again by deleting the logs and history. Use the following command to remove the log entries for the last import of a given name:

```shell
$ php bin/magento import:clear-last <import-name>
```

## Import Locking

When an import is running it will be locked. This prevents the same import running again while the first has not finished. This is useful in the case that you need files
to be imported sequentially but the first is taking a longer time than expected and the second is due to start. The locking mechanism will cause the new import to be skipped until
the first is finished.

Import locks are stored in the table `jh_import_lock`. If for some reason a lock is not released you can manually release it like so:

```shell
$ php bin/magento import:unlock <import-name>
```

## Archiving
 
After an import source has finished being processed it is passed to an archiver. Each source type is mapped to it's own archiver. See [src/Archiver/Factory.php](src/Archiver/Factory.php) for the mappings.

Depending on whether the import is deemed successful or not it is moved to an archived folder or a failed folder respectively. These folders come from your import configuration at `app/code/MyVendor/Import/etc/imports.xml`. 

If the folders are not specified in the config then the defaults will be used: `jh_import/incoming`, `jh_import/archived` & `jh_import/failed`. All these folders will be created inside the Magento `var` folder.
 
The file name will be changed to include the current timestamp (time of moving) to prevent race conditions.

### What causes an import to be failed?
 
During the process of importing through the various components - a report object is passed around so the source/transformers/filters and writers can
add debug information and errors. The report object is an instance of `\Jh\Import\Report\Report` - see: [src/Report/Report.php](src/Report/Report.php).

Entries can be added with any of the Log Levels defined in [src/LogLevel.php](src/LogLevel.php). If you see the `$failedLogLevels` property in [src/Report/Report.php](src/Report/Report.php)
you will see the error levels which it regards as failures. So any message added to the report with a level which exists in the `$failedLogLevels` array will cause the import to be failed.

## File Cleanup

The `archived` & `failed` directories will soon start to contain many files that take up a lot of space. In order for this to not get out of hand we offer
two strategies for keeping the file numbers down. They are both opt-in so they will need to be enabled in your import configuration.

### Zip Cron

This cron job runs at 1AM every sunday. For each import that has it enabled it will scan each of the failed and archived directories looking for files older than 3 days. It will zip
these files together and delete the original files. If there are no files older than 3 days in either of the folders then no zip will be created. A zip will be created in each of the folders
name like `archived-d-m-Y-H-i.zip` where `d-m-Y-H-i` will be substituted with the date/time of the zip creation.

To enable, set `archive_old_files` to `1` in your `app/code/MyVendor/Import/etc/imports.xml` file, like so:

```xml
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:module:Jh_Import:etc/imports.xsd">
    <files name="price">
        <source>Jh\Import\Source\Csv</source>
        <incoming_directory>jh_import/incoming</source>
        <match_files>/price_\d{8}.csv/</source>
        <specification>MyVendor\Import\Specification\Price</specification>
        <writer>MyVendor\Import\Writer\Price</specification>
        <id_field>sku</id_field>
        <cron>vendor_import_product</cron>
        <archive_old_files>1</archive_old_files>
    </files>
</config>
```

### Delete Cron

This cron job runs at 1AM every day. For each import that has it enabled it will scan each of the failed and archived directories looking for files older than 2 weeks (14 days)/ It will delete
all of those files.

To enable, set `delete_old_files` to `1` in your `app/code/MyVendor/Import/etc/imports.xml` file, like so:

```xml
<config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:module:Jh_Import:etc/imports.xsd">
    <files name="price">
        <source>Jh\Import\Source\Csv</source>
        <incoming_directory>jh_import/incoming</source>
        <match_files>/price_\d{8}.csv/</source>
        <specification>MyVendor\Import\Specification\Price</specification>
        <writer>MyVendor\Import\Writer\Price</specification>
        <id_field>sku</id_field>
        <cron>vendor_import_product</cron>
        <delete_old_files>1</archive_old_files>
    </files>
</config>
```
